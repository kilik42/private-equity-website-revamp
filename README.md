# Short Private Equity – Website Redesign

This is a redesigned and modernized version of the **Short Private Equity** website, inspired by Jared Dillian’s appearance on *Breaking Points*. The goal of this redesign is to make the critically important information on the site more **accessible**, **readable**, and **engaging**, especially for visitors who may not have deep background knowledge in finance or private equity.

## 🎯 Purpose

The original site is packed with powerful, relevant content — but its dense structure may overwhelm or deter curious, everyday users. This redesign aims to:

- Simplify navigation
- Organize content visually with cards and categories
- Guide newcomers with an introduction and glossary
- Integrate video and downloads more clearly
- Improve mobile responsiveness and accessibility

## ✨ Features

- 🧭 **Clean UI** with a card-based layout
- 📖 **Beginner-Friendly Introduction** section
- 🔍 **Search bar** for exploring articles or terms
- 📹 **Embedded explainer video** (e.g., Big Short 2.0)
- 📘 **Glossary** of key Private Equity terms
- 📥 **Email signup form** for free downloads
- 🔗 **Footer with navigation links**
- © **Copyright section** styled professionally
